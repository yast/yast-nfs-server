Installation
------------

To install the latest stable version on openSUSE or SLE, use zypper:

    $ zypper install yast2-nfs-server

You can also install the lastest development version. To do that, you need to
add the [YaST:Head](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/YaST:Head)
repository to your system first (you may need to change the `openSUSE_12.3` part
of the repository URL according to the system you are installing at):

    $ sudo zypper addrepo \
        http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/YaST:/Head/openSUSE_12.3/ \
        YaST:Head
        
Then you can install the module:

    $ sudo zypper install -r YaST:Head:ruby yast2-nfs server

Running
-------

To tun the module, use the following command:

    $ /sbin/yast2 nfs-server

This will run the module in your desktop environment (if you have one running)
of in text mode. For more options, see section on [running modules](TODO) in the
YaST documentation.
